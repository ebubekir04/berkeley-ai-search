## Project Overview

This repository contains implementations of different search algorithms for solving pathfinding and problem-solving tasks, including:
- A* Search
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)

The main goal is to provide clear, tested, and well-documented code for classic search problems in Artificial Intelligence.

## Collaboration & Credits

This project was a **collaborative effort** by Ebubekir Kahriman and Mohamed Amine Zarouali.  
Originally developed together for a course at VUB, further updated here for portfolio and academic purposes.
